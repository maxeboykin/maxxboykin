### What stands between someone achieving their most ambitious dreams has less to do with talent or inate skill and more to do with approaching a problem and decision making. Making decisions occurs far often than we think. It happens millions of times each day. Because of the continuous and compounding nature of all these millions of decisions that we face on a regular basis, even a marginal improvement in our process can have a huge impact in our ability. This space represents my journey into designing software and technology, one line of code..one 0 or 1..one pixel at a time.

- ðŸ˜„ I'm Max, an engineer, one of the 7.1 x 10^9 individuals striving to grow and progress on :earth_americas:.

- :memo: Now don't get those feelings of melancholy due to the limited projects finished in this space. Iâ€™m currently working on a pathfinder visualizer project as well as a few other smaller private projects. Now, now, now... I am not one for clandestine or surreptitious relationships but that's the way this has got to be. :zipper_mouth_face:.

- :croissant:	Have been a long-time learner of the most fickle quadrinomial problem in homo-sapien history.. the mercurial relationship between flour, water, salt and yeast...just don't ask me to add the fifth variable of olive oil to make ciabatta.  
 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about designing a product and delivering it to the market successfully. Success isn't serendipitous if you follow the right steps. I have five years of product management experience in the computer industry :computer:	:desktop_computer:	. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I compete in triathlons :swimmer:	:biking_man:	:running_man:	and am an avid reader of books :monocle_face:	. I have volunteered in Rwanda :rwanda:	, South Africa :south_africa:	and Peru :peru:	and hope to continue my global awareness journey after this persnickety pandemic comes to an end.
